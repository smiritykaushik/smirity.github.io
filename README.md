I am a Doctoral student at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. My research interest lies at the intersection of usable privacy and explainable AI. I previously worked as a Privacy Consultant at Ernst & Young (EY) North America practice, primarily serving multi-national technology sector clients in Silicon Valley and the Greater Seattle area. I am skilled in compliance with US privacy laws and EU-GDPR. I also hold a JD equivalent law degree from India and an MS in Information Management degree from Syracuse University. I strongly support empowering and encouraging women in technology and other fields.
